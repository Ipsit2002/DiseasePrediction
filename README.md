# Disease Prediction System

## Overview
The Disease Prediction System uses Decision Tree algorithms to diagnose diseases based on user-provided symptoms. The system employs a user-friendly graphical interface developed using Tkinter, which allows users to input symptoms and receive disease predictions in an easy-to-understand format.

## Features
- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis**: Uses the Decision Tree algorithm to predict potential diseases based on the symptoms entered by the user.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Tkinter, providing an intuitive graphical interface for symptom input and displaying prediction results.
- **Accurate Prediction**: Provides accurate predictions by analyzing the input symptoms and comparing them with known disease patterns.
- **Quick and Efficient**: The system can instantly process user input and provide predictions, making it a valuable tool for quick disease diagnosis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core language for implementing the decision tree algorithm and handling backend logic.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI) to collect user input and display results.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the Decision Tree algorithm to perform disease prediction based on symptoms.

## Installation
